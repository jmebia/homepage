This is my personal website to showcase myself and my work. This website (for now) basically serves as a page of links to my social media sites I want to publicize and am currently (quite) active on (GitHub, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter).

<b>NOTE:</b> This webpage is currently a <b>work in progress</b>.
