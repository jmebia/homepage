# Hi! I'm J.M. Ebia

## What I do
By day, I mainly do backend web applications development at KodeTeQ, an I.T. solutions company based in the Philippines.

By night (and weekends!), I dive into my more creative side â€” designing and developing indie games in Godot.

Outside my working hours, I am a full-time beagle parent and I love to play either digital or tabletop games. I also do digital illustrations and post them online!

> TLDR; I'm a full-stack web developer / indie game dev / beagle-dad / gamer / artist
